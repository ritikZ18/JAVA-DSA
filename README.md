## üìò Intellectual Java Insights

### 1. **Advanced Java Constructs**:
- **Generics**: All data structures are implemented using Java generics to ensure type safety and flexibility.
  ```java
  public class BinarySearchTree<T extends Comparable<T>> {
      // Generic implementation to handle any comparable type
  }
  ```
- **Concurrency**: Certain algorithms like **parallel mergesort** or **multi-threaded matrix multiplication** are implemented to leverage Java's **ExecutorService** and **Fork/Join framework** for performance on large datasets.
  
### 2. **Immutable Objects in DSA**:
- Immutable objects are used in algorithms to ensure **thread-safety** and **predictable behavior**. This is especially useful in **functional-style programming** using Java Streams.
  ```java
  final class Node<T> {
      private final T value;
      private final Node<T> next;
      // Immutable node structure
  }
  ```

### 3. **Java Collections Framework**:
- Leverage built-in data structures like `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, and `PriorityQueue` but also implement **custom versions** of these for deeper understanding.

### 4. **Java 8 Functional Programming**:
- **Lambda Expressions** and **Streams** are used to improve the clarity and conciseness of code. Complex transformations and filtering operations are done in a functional style.
  ```java
  List<Integer> squares = numbers.stream()
      .map(x -> x * x)
      .collect(Collectors.toList());
  ```

### 5. **Memory Management and Optimization**:
- Special attention is given to memory usage. **Space complexity** is always calculated and noted, ensuring that implementations are memory efficient.
- Techniques like **lazy evaluation** and **tail-recursion optimization** are also employed when necessary.
